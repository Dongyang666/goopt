A getopt-like processor of command-line flags.  It works much like the
"flag" package, only it processes arguments in a way that is
compatible with the
[getopt_long](http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html#Argument-Syntax)
syntax, which is an extension of the syntax recommended by POSIX.
